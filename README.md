# Millimeter Wave (mmWave)-Enabled Vehicular Relay Network Simulation

A mmWave vehicular network in a highway scenario is simulated. mmWave-enabled vehicles communicate with the roadside units (RSUs) either over direct vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, or through other mmWave-enable vehicles that act as relays.

## Running the code:

First, run 'generate_config.m' to generate configuration files. Then, run 'run_simulation(config, vehicleProperties)'.
